# system-calls

This project consists of several C programs that demonstrate the use of various system calls in 
Linux to retrieve and manipulate system and process information, as well as manage files. 
The programs included in this project are:

1. "info.c":  Displays system-level information such as time, network name, OS details, 
              and memory status.

2. "pinfo.c": Retrieves and displays process information for a given process ID, 
              including priority and scheduling method.

3. "pmod.c":  Modifies the current process's priority, sleeps for a specific amount 
              of time, and prints a goodbye message.

4. "finfo.c": Displays detailed information about a specified file, such as type, 
              permissions, owner, size, and last modification date.
